## Hello! My name is Noah Hodge
I am a Computer Science major at Grace College, with a minor in mathematics. I'm still learning a lot of the basics of full-stack development, but fortunately learning is a passion of mine! I think I am better suited to back-end, but I'll learn where I thrive as I learn more about computer science! I have always had an interest in technology, especially the inner workings of it! Though I like learning about hardawre, I think software is where I would like to be professionally.

## What I Know
Most of my experience is in Python, but I've also learned some basics in Java, C#, HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL. I hope to learn a few more of the major languages, as well as generally improve my knowledge of logic and programming!

Most of what I've done fits in back-end, but I hope to learn how to work with UI someday.

## Projects
- Learning web development and applying it in projects
- Learning about industry tools and using them
- Contribution to bone segmentation of the fingers

## More About Me
- Generalist nerd -- I collect all sorts of facts on a variety of topics! Star Wars, historical armaments, macaroni and cheese, and the wild aspects of our world!
- I enjoy video games quite a bit, with no real preferred genres. Current favorites include Warframe, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, and Crypt of the NecroDancer!
- I play lots of TTRPG with my friends! Currently involved in D&D 5e, Pathfinder 2e, and Monster of the Week. Hoping to play Cyberpunk 2020 and Starfinder 2e in the near future!
- Working on reading more. Commonly banned dystopians, Asimov, and The Dresden Files are at the top!
- Avid drinker of tea! London Fogs for when I'm feeling fancy, simple sweet tea for whenever, and straight black tea for when I need to focus.
